# E2E Tests

To run the tests, navigate to the `tests` directory and run the following command to install dependencies:

```bash
./setup_e2e_playwright.sh
```

You can then execute the tests with:

```bash
./run_e2e_tests.sh
```

These tests will verify the most of the base functionality of both the UI and the API.
