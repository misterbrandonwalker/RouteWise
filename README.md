# aspire-network-visualizer
New light-weight version of the Network Visualizer for graph rendering and investigation

## Running visualizer instance locally

You'll need to clone this repository first and be sure you have your Docker deamon up and running.

Then, go to the project root folder and run the following command: `docker-compose up -d`

Once all related instances will be up - go to http://localhost:3033 to play around.

You can use attached JSON examples (`json-examples` folder) to render some prepared graphs.
